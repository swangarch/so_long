## Project Structure

- **src/** â€” Source code files
- **header/** â€” Header files
- **maps/** â€” Sample map files (`.ber` format)
- **mlx_linux/** â€” MiniLibX graphics library for Linux

## Requirements

- Linux environment (Ubuntu or similar)
- gcc compiler
- MiniLibX (included in the repo)
- Make

## Build

bash
make (make bonus for bonus feature)

This will compile the executable so_long (so_long_bonus).

## Run
bash
Copy
Edit
./so_long maps/example.ber
Replace example.ber with your own map file. The map file must be in the correct format (rectangular, surrounded by walls, with at least one collectible and one exit).

Controls
W/A/S/D or arrow keys to move the player

ESC to exit the game

Map Format
1 â€” Wall
0 â€” Empty space
C â€” Collectible
E â€” Exit
P â€” Player start position

## Notes
The game ends when the player collects all collectibles and reaches the exit.

Invalid maps will cause the program to exit with an error message.
